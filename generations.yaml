    description: "The original Peugeot e-208 was introduced as the all-electric variant of the second-generation 208 supermini, built on PSA's multi-energy CMP (Common Modular Platform) designed to accommodate various powertrains without compromising design or interior space. Visually almost identical to its combustion-engine siblings but distinguished by body-colored grille with dichroic lion emblem, e-208 badges, and distinctive alloy wheel designs. Powered by a 100 kW (136 hp) electric motor producing 260 Nm of instant torque, with a 50 kWh lithium-ion battery providing approximately 217 miles (350 km) of range under WLTP testing. Performance was brisk with 0-62 mph acceleration in 8.1 seconds and a top speed electronically limited to 93 mph. Three driving modes were available: Eco (limiting power to maximize range), Normal, and Sport (prioritizing performance). Regenerative braking offered two settings, controlled via the gear selector. Charging capabilities included support for up to 100 kW DC fast charging, allowing an 80% charge in approximately 30 minutes. The interior featured Peugeot's i-Cockpit design with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument panel, 3D digital instrument cluster, and 7 or 10-inch central touchscreen depending on trim level. Dedicated EV-specific displays showed energy flow, charging status, and remained largely identical to combustion models apart from these specialized screens and controls. The e-208 offered the same 311-liter cargo capacity as conventional 208 models thanks to the platform's design. This first generation established Peugeot's approach to electric vehicles by maintaining the style, practicality, and driving characteristics of its conventional models while adding the benefits of electric propulsion."

    description: "The refreshed Peugeot e-208 features updated exterior styling aligned with Peugeot's evolving design language, including a new front fascia with three-claw LED headlights, redesigned grille, and the brand's new lion-head logo. The most significant changes are technical, with a substantially improved powertrain featuring a more efficient electric motor now producing 115 kW (156 hp) and 260 Nm of torque, paired with a larger 51 kWh (48.1 kWh usable) battery. These enhancements increase the WLTP range to approximately 248 miles (400 km)â€”a 15% improvement over the previous version. The more powerful motor improves acceleration and overall driving dynamics while maintaining the model's focus on efficiency. Charging capabilities remain similar with support for up to 100 kW DC fast charging. The interior receives minor updates including the latest generation infotainment system with customizable i-toggles (on higher trims), improved connected services, and over-the-air update capability. The refreshed e-208 maintains the model's approach of offering electric propulsion without compromise to style or practicality, now with improved performance and range. These enhancements help maintain the e-208's competitive position against newer rivals in the rapidly evolving electric supermini segment, particularly important as Peugeot accelerates its electrification strategy across its product lineup."
