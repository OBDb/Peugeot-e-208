    description: "The Peugeot e-208 was introduced as the all-electric variant of the second-generation 208 supermini, unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2019 and going on sale that summer. Built on PSA's multi-energy CMP (Common Modular Platform), the e-208 shares its chassis with conventional petrol/diesel versions, allowing assembly on the same production line at the Trnava plant in Slovakia. Visually almost identical to its combustion-engine siblings but distinguished by specific styling elements and the absence of a traditional grille. Powered by a 100 kW (136 hp) electric motor producing 260 Nm of instant torque, with a 50 kWh lithium-ion battery providing approximately 211-217 miles (340-350 km) of range under WLTP testing. Performance was brisk with 0-62 mph acceleration in 8.1 seconds and a top speed of 93 mph. Three driving modes were available: Eco, Normal, and Sport. Regenerative braking offered adjustable settings controlled via the gear selector. Charging capabilities included a CCS Combo Type 2 connector supporting up to 100 kW DC fast charging (70 kW up to 40% state of charge, then decreasing to 50 kW), with an onboard charger limited to 7.4 kW (optional 11 kW three-phase available). The interior featured Peugeot's i-Cockpit design with a small steering wheel positioned below the instrument panel, digital instrument cluster, and 7 or 10-inch central touchscreen depending on trim level. The e-208 was approximately 300 kg heavier than conventional versions due to the battery pack, but maintained the same 311-liter cargo capacity. Demand was strong at launch, with over 60% of pre-orders initially for the e-208 variant."

    description: "The refreshed Peugeot e-208 was introduced in July 2023 alongside the facelifted second-generation 208 lineup, featuring updated exterior styling aligned with Peugeot's evolving design language. The exterior updates include a new front end with redesigned headlights, front apron and grille, while the rear receives new tail lights. LED headlights and partial LED tail lights became standard, with full LED options available. The grille maintains its proportions but features new designs with body-colored elements and incorporates three vertical lines as the new light signature and DRLs. The interior receives an upgraded infotainment system with a 10-inch display as standard (up from 7-inch), while the base trim retains an analogue cockpit. New interior fabrics are also available. The most significant technical change for the e-208 is a more powerful electric motor now producing 115 kW (156 hp), providing increased performance and efficiency. The WLTP range increases accordingly, representing an improvement over the pre-facelift model. Charging capabilities remain similar with support for up to 100 kW DC fast charging. The refreshed e-208 maintains the model's approach of offering electric propulsion without compromise to style or practicality, now with improved performance and range that helps maintain competitiveness against newer rivals in the rapidly evolving electric supermini segment."
